<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left

    <p><h3>PROJECT 1: Flarf Poem</h3></br>Project 1 is a flarf poem made from the last text that I sent to one of my friends with the text being "Oh that's cool".
    The flarf poem itself is made from the Google results that appeared after typing "Oh that's cool" and the results were rearranged to my own liking.

    <p><h3>PROJECT 2: Zoom Green Screen Background</h3></br>Project 2 is a Green Screen background video that was applied during a Zoom meeting. The effect that I applied was to show that when I put my head down and was not aware of my background.
    The background would distort as I set my head down until I was aware of my surroundings it go away.
